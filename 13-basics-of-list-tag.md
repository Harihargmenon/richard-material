# Understanding List Tag

A list helps us display important information in a concise and easy-to-read manner. You would have seen lists on websites around you, lists of Google search results, lists of runs scored by batsmen on sports results, etc. In HTML we have different kinds of lists to display different kinds of information. We have namely 3 kinds of lists, ordered lists, unordered lists, and description lists. 
Unordered List: An unordered list is used when you want to present a list of items that don't have a specific order or sequence.
Unordered lists are defined by the tag <ul> and each element <li>. Let’s take a sample shopping list your mom gave you
<ul>
   <li>Washing Powder</li>
  <li>Milk.</li>
  <li>Aata.</li>
</ul>
These list items, don’t need to follow any specific order, as long as you remember to buy all the items your mom would not mind the order you buy the items in.

Ordered List: An ordered list is used when you want to present a list of items in a specific order or sequence.
Unordered lists are defined by the tag <ol> and each element <li>.
Let’s say your mom wants to teach you how to make lemonade, let’s make a list of steps for the process
<ol>
<li>In a large pitcher, combine the lemon juice and sugar.</li>
<li>Stir until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
<li>Add the water and ice cubes, if desired.</li>
<li>Stir gently and serve.</li>
</ol>
Here you will see, that the order of steps is important. If you change the sequence of steps you would not get the desired lemonade, hence here we use an ordered list.
Description List: A description list is used to present a list of terms (labels) and their corresponding descriptions
Here <dl> defines the description list, <dt> is the the description term and <dd> is the description details.
<dl>
  <dt>Taj Mahal (India)</dt>
  <dd>A stunning white marble mausoleum, the Taj Mahal is a symbol of eternal love.</dd>
  <dt>Great Wall of China (China)</dt>
  <dd>A monumental defensive structure, the Great Wall stretches across northern China, built to protect against invasions.</dd>
  </dl>
Here is a list of few wonders and a one line description about them.
