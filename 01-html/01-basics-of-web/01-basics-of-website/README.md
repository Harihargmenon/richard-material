# Understanding Websites and Web Browsers

A website is a single page or multiple pages that are made up of texts, images, videos and other types of content styles together according to certain rules. Websites can be about anything, you can have websites where people share their thoughts in an audio-visual format like Instagram/Twitter, websites can be about product pages for shopping like Amazon/Flipkart or websites can be online games like Miniclip. In this course, we'll teach you how to make websites, the basic rules that govern websites and how you can get creative to build your website.

To view a webpage, you need a web browser, such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc. The website is an application that allows you to view web pages on the internet. It is like a window into the internet, allowing you to access and interact with the information and resources that are available online. Once you have a web browser, you can type the webpage's address (or URL) into the address bar and press Enter. The web browser will then download the webpage from the internet and display it to you.

In this course we won’t be going deeper into the workings of the Web Browser, we’ll get hands-on experience on how you can use browsers to learn programming.
