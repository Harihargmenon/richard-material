# Understanding Attributes in HTML
As we have defined earlier, each tag in HTML has a certain functionality. On the core functionality, we'll add certain features that change the shape, size, colour and other properties of that tag keeping the core functionality the same. These attributes allow us to specify how the HTML elements will look and behave. 

Letâ€™s write an HTML paragraph in red colour with a font size of 20
```html
<p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">This text is red and 20 pixels tall.</p>
```
The style attribute specifies the styling of the paragraph element. In this case, it tells us that the colour of the paragraph would be red and the font size would be 20 pixels.
As we learn ahead we will learn about many more attributes with different functionality.
