# Understanding Heading Tags

Whenever you start making your website, you would want users to be able to navigate through it with ease. One important part of this is labelling different sections of your websites with headings/sub-headings to make the purpose of each section clear. HTML heading tag allows you to do that. It gives us the flexibility of using 6 different heading tags, from <h1> to <h6>. Generally <h1> is the biggest tag and <h6> is the smallest tag. We are advised to use upto <h4> tag.
The block-level behaviour in paragraph tags is also observed in the heading tag
Sample Code
```html
<h1>This is the main heading</h1>
<h2>This is a subheading</h2>
<h3>This is a sub-subheading</h3>
<p> Well, I can go on  but you get the idea </p>
```
