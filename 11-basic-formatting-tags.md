# Basic Formatting Tags

Now, we’ll go over some formatting tags that are used to give basic styling to HTML tags to make them look more presentable. These tags don’t alter the content of the tag just alter the format of it. Let’s look at a few basic formatting tags.

## Strong Tag
The HTML ```<strong>``` element defines text with strong importance. This tag is often employed to highlight keywords or phrases within a sentence or paragraph to convey importance to the reader.
```html
<strong>This text is important!</strong>
```
<strong>This text is important!</strong>
## Emphasis Tag
The ```<em>``` tag in HTML is used to define text that has emphasized importance. It typically renders the enclosed text in italics by default in most browsers. It indicates that the enclosed text should be emphasized in a way that is meaningful to the document structure. Screen readers and other assistive technologies can interpret the ```<em>``` tag as a signal that the enclosed text is of particular importance or emphasis. 
```html
<em>This text is emphasized</em>
```
<em>This text is emphasized</em>
## Marked Text Tag
```<mark>``` - Marked text
The HTML ```<mark>``` element defines text that should be marked or highlighted:
```html
<p>I want to learn <mark>programming</mark> today.</p>
```
<p>I want to learn <mark>programming</mark> today.</p>

### Subscript Tag
```<sub>``` - Subscript text
The HTML ```<sub>``` element defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas
```html
<p>H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
```
<p>H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

### Superscript Tag

```<sup>``` - Superscript text

The HTML ```<sup>``` element defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Superscript text can be used for footnotes. 
```html
<p>1<sup>st</sup></p>
```
 <p>1<sup>st</sup></p>

Now many more formatting tags can be explored. In the coming sections, we’ll deep dive into detailed styling, which would give us more freedom than these basic tags
