# Understanding Padding and Margins

An important aspect of styling is how each element is spaced with respect to other elements, this decides the layout of our web page. 
These layouts are not only important from a visual appeal point of view but also affect how users use a particular website feature. <Add Exampl>. 
With respect to this spacing, we’ll try to understand the basic styling attributes, padding, and margins
 
**Margin** - This is the space outside the element's border. This attribute creates space between different elements
```html
<p style=”margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:15px;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px">I am writing a sentence with margin around it</p>
```
So here each margin-top, margin-bottom, margin-left, and margin-right sets the margin value in different directions for this paragraph. 
We can also write this as
```html
<p style=”margin:10px 15px; 5px; 5px">I am writing a sentence with margin around it</p>
```

**Padding** - Padding is the space between the content of the element and the boundary of the element. This is used the set the internal spacing of the element, creating a separation between the content and the border
```html
<p style=”padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:15px;padding-left:5px;padding-right:5px">I am writing a sentence with padding around it</p>
```
So here each padding-top, padding-bottom, padding-left, and padding-right sets the margin value in different directions for this paragraph. 
Similarly, we can also write this as
```html
<p style=”padding:10px 15px; 5px; 5px">I am writing a sentence with margin around it</p>
```
