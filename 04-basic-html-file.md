# Understanding an HTML Document

Let's take this sample HTML file to understand some basic HTML tags
```html
<html>
<head>
<title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>I think I am already a programmer!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

An HTML program is filled with tags, enclosed by '<>', each tag has a definite purpose. One common thread you'll find in most  HTML programs is that most opened tag needs to be closed for unambiguous structure(except for a few tags we'll learn with time)
Let's understand each tag in this program
- `<html>`: This acts like the root of the HTML document. The <html> tag is the foundational element that wraps around the entire HTML document, providing structure, language information, and character encoding details. It serves as the starting point for organizing and presenting content on a webpage.
- `<head>`: This contains metadata and other essential information about the document. It is a crucial part of the HTML document structure and is placed within the <html> tag. The <head> section does not directly contribute to the visible content of the webpage but contains information that helps browsers and other agents interpret and display the document correctly.
- `<title>`: Inside the head tag we have the title tag. This tag sets the title of the webpage. It's the name that shows up on the browser tab. In this case, "My First Web Page"
- `<body>`: This is where we put all the things that we want to show on the webpage. The computer reads this part and displays it on the screen.
- `<h1>`: This is the biggest heading on the webpage. It tells us the main title, which is "This is my first web page!" in this case.

Going forward you will learn different tags and how we will go about applying them.
