# Understanding Box Model Basics
To understand styling better, letâ€™s build a framework to view every element. We need to understand how each element in HTML is styled we need to understand what exactly each element is. Each element in HTML is a box. Every kind of tag
is a box, be text or audio or video content, everything is a box. And as you can imagine a box can have 4 properties.

Each element in HTML can be considered like a box with 4 major parts:

**Content**: Inside the box, this is the main information of each element, like text or image. This can be considered as the main part.

**Padding**: This is like having a cushion around the content inside each box. This is the space between the content and the border.

**Border**: This is the edge of the box. This can have varying thickness

**Margin**: Finally the margin is the space between different boxes. The space between different elements of the webpage

Going forward all the styling elements we learn will create changes to these 4 aspects of each element. It is the interaction of all these four properties of each element on the website that leads to the overall layout. 
Below we are seeing the box model of a google homepage search button.

Here,
The main content is "Google Search". Inside the box around the "Google Search" text is the **padding**, around the **padding** is a **border** on minimal thickness and around the **border** there is a **margin** space. You can do this analysis by inspect element on any website
