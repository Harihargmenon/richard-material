# Understanding List Tag

A list helps us display important information in a concise and easy-to-read manner. You would have seen lists on websites around you, lists of Google search results, lists of runs scored by batsmen on sports results, etc. In HTML we have different kinds of lists to display different kinds of information. We have namely 2 kinds of lists, ordered lists and unordered lists
## Unordered List
An unordered list is used when you want to present a list of items that don't have a specific order or sequence. Unordered lists are defined by the tag ```<ul>``` and each element ```<li>```. Let’s take a sample shopping list your mom gave you
```html
<ul>
   <li>Washing Powder</li>
  <li>Milk.</li>
  <li>Aata.</li>
</ul>
```
<ul>
   <li>Washing Powder</li>
  <li>Milk.</li>
  <li>Aata.</li>
</ul>
These list items, don’t need to follow any specific order, as long as you remember to buy all the items your mom would not mind the order you buy the items in.

## Ordered List
An ordered list is used when you want to present a list of items in a specific order or sequence. Ordered lists are defined by the tag ```<ol>``` and each element ```<li>```.
Let’s say your mom wants to teach you how to make lemonade, let’s make a list of steps for the process
```html
<ol>
<li>In a large pitcher, combine the lemon juice and sugar.</li>
<li>Stir until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
<li>Add the water and ice cubes, if desired.</li>
<li>Stir gently and serve.</li>
</ol>
```
<ol>
<li>In a large pitcher, combine the lemon juice and sugar.</li>
<li>Stir until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
<li>Add the water and ice cubes, if desired.</li>
<li>Stir gently and serve.</li>
</ol>
Here you will see, that the order of steps is important. If you change the sequence of steps you will not get the desired lemonade, hence here we use an ordered list.

## Nesting Of Lists
As we have learned in the nesting chapter. Lists can be nested together, where you can have any combination of ordered and unordered lists inside each other. Visit the last section to read that part again.
