# Understanding Paragraph Tags

Simply put, this tag is used to add paragraphs to your web page. 
The HTML paragraph tag, <p>, is used to define a paragraph of text. It is a block-level element, which means that it starts on a new line and takes up the full width of the available space.
To create a paragraph of text, you simply wrap the text in <p> and </p> tags. For example:
```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```
Inside the paragraph tag, all the spaces before all the content and all spaces outside the content are ignored, and within the content all spaces are reduced to one.
```html
<p>           This              is   an              example   with  extra     spaces.         </p>
```
