# Understanding HTML

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages. HTML is used to define the structure, content, and functionality of a web page. Let's try to understand what the terms hypertext and markup language mean.

## Hypertext

When you compare a website and any other document, websites allow you to click on certain buttons or links which take you to other websites that give you more information. This feature is missing from a traditional physical document. The ability to jump over from one document to another using links. This kind of a document which contains link is a Hypertext document. Hypertext refers to a word, phrase or chunk of text that can be linked to another document or text. In a hypertext document the text which act as links to other documents are called hyperlinks. Shopping websites like Amazon or Ebooks are great examples of Hypertext documents that interlink websites using links. Hypertext links allow you to jump from one part of a document to another, or even to another document altogether. This makes it easy to explore a topic in depth without having to flip back and forth through the entire document




## Markup Language

When we were defining a website, we talked about how websites are made of text/images/videos and other content in a set of rules that define its layout and presentation. We need a certain set of rules so that the browser knows what needs to be displayed and in what format and layout. These rules are dictated by markup languages. In this course we'll learn what those different rules our that we need to follow while making websites.

If you try to club these two definitions HTML is a set a rules dictating how different elements of a website interact and it allows different websites to be interlinked together.

HTML is made up of tags, which are special words or phrases enclosed in angle brackets (< >). Tags tell the web browser how to display the content of a web page. For example, let's say we have a tag called <tag_name> used to display text. This tag would look something like : 
`<tag_name>Tag Content </tag_name>` 
or often like :
`<tag_name content=tag_content />`

In this course you'll learn about a lot of tags which allow you to do a lot of amazing things in HTML. Next chapter we'll look at a basic HTML file
